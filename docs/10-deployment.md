# 10 Deployment

## Purpose
This document defines local Docker Compose runtime and future V2 cloud deployment plan.

## Status
Draft

This document will be expanded in later steps.

What belongs here:
- Local runtime setup.
- Service dependency model.
- Future cloud deployment architecture.

## Local Secret Handling

- Keep runtime secrets in local shell environment or ignored `.env` files only.
- `.env.example` may show placeholder variable names, but must not contain real
  credentials.
- `.env` and `.env.*` must stay ignored by Git so local Notion, OpenAI, and
  Telegram credentials never enter the repository.
