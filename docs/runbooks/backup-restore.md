# Backup and Restore Runbook

## Scope and safety

PostgreSQL/pgvector contains rebuildable application state; current Notion
content remains authoritative. Never restore over an active database as the
first validation. Stop the API and worker before replacing a local target.

- Keep archives outside Git and protect them with filesystem permissions.
- Take a fresh backup before restore or migration.
- Do not use `pg_restore --clean` against an active or unknown database.
- Do not edit Notion while database state is being restored.
- Do not expose database URLs, passwords, tokens, private content, or raw
  driver errors in logs or reports.

## Create a backup

Use a password manager, `.pgpass`, or a process environment for credentials:

```bash
BACKUP_FILE="./data/backups/learnloop-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.dump"
mkdir -p ./data/backups
pg_dump --format=custom --no-owner \
  --file "$BACKUP_FILE" \
  --dbname "$POSTGRES_DATABASE_NAME"
pg_restore --list "$BACKUP_FILE" >/dev/null
```

The archive listing validates the file format. Keep the archive until restore
verification is complete.

## Disposable restore drill

The project drill creates disposable database names, applies real Alembic
migrations, restores a sentinel, verifies the migration table, and removes
only the generated databases:

```bash
uv run --no-env-file --frozen python \
  scripts/postgres_restore_drill.py --json
```

For a live drill, provide an administrator URL for a disposable PostgreSQL
server and an explicit disposable confirmation:

```bash
uv run --no-env-file --frozen python \
  scripts/postgres_restore_drill.py \
  --run \
  --confirm-disposable-target DISPOSABLE \
  --admin-database-url "$LEARNLOOP_RESTORE_DRILL_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL" \
  --json
```

If cleanup fails, do not reuse generated database names until their exact
scope and connections are verified.

## Restore an application database

1. Stop API and worker processes.
2. Record safe workflow, migration, and readiness status.
3. Take a fresh backup of the current database.
4. Restore into a new database:

   ```bash
   createdb "$RESTORE_DATABASE_NAME"
   pg_restore --exit-on-error --no-owner \
     --dbname "$RESTORE_DATABASE_NAME" "$BACKUP_FILE"
   uv run --no-env-file --frozen alembic upgrade head
   ```

5. Verify `alembic current`, database connectivity, pgvector, and `/ready`
   against the restored target.
6. Rebuild derived state from current Notion with
   `POST /api/notion/index/full`. Use incremental sync only when the affected
   page set is known and the restore is otherwise complete.
7. Verify a scoped QA citation and production-RAG exclusion before resuming
   accepted appends.

Record only archive format, drill checks, migration status, readiness, bounded
counts, citation count, operator, and timestamp.
